# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

Explanaition of phenomena:

# Start Hours by Age Group
* Here we see that the highest traffic times for CitiBike usage are around typical work-day commute times - major peaks at 8 am and 5-6pm, with small peaks around 12pm. 
* We also see that the typical working-age groups (20 - 60 years old), the usage numbers are highest.
* The trends do tend to lessen and smooth slightly as age increases over 40 years old.

# Number of Subscribers by Age Group
* Here we see how the percentages of the subscriber-base are brokendown by age
* In correlation to the usage, the largest percentages of subscribers are 20 - 60 years old, with the highest eing 30 - 39

# Subscribers vs. Non-subscribers by Gender
* Here we see the breakdown of the subscriber-base specifically by gender
* This reveals that males are the largest percentage of subscribers
* It also shows us that most of all unknown-gendered users are not subscribers. This is most likely explained by the lack of data collection that often happens with a subscription

# Average Trip Duration
* This shows us that the unknown gender group has the highest trip duration. This is encouraging because, as we know, almost all unknown-gendered users are not subscribers. This means that there is a large client base that uses CitiBikes for extended time, which should mean satisfaction. 
* The takeaway is that the subscriptions should be continually pushed to these frequent users.

# Number of Trips by Age Group and Gender
* This shows us the breakdown of CitiBike usage by age and gender (excluding unknown)
* It reiterates that the largest portion of the userbase is males aged 20 - 60, with about as many 50 - 59 year old males as the largest group of females (30 - 39)
* This helps us to see where the concentration of business is as well as potential need for targeted marketing towards women
